This experiment checks whether randomization can enhance the performance of the "Greedy-2" algorithm. 

The experiment E0 validated that competitive ratio of "Greedy-2" algorithm is 4 in the worst case, and we maneged to produced a job sequence causing the algorithm to behave in the worst case. That job sequence is SchemeGeometricSets with growth rate 2.

In this experiment, we will first add randomization into the naive "Greedy-2" algorithm. For example, a randomized "Greedy-2,4" algorithm is a mix of "Greedy-2" and "Greedy-4" with decision made by chance. Theoritically the competitive ratio would decrease since it avoids the worst case job sequence that targets at "Greedy-2" algorithm.  

However, there are at least two uncertainties we hold. (1) How to choose another algorithm that would be mixed with "Greedy-2"? Should they have a higher abortion ratio or lower? (2) What probability should be given for each algorithm? 

For this time, we will assume 1/2 is the answer for the second question and primarily focus on the first question.

Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Preparations: 1. Implement a mixed-abortion-ratio algorithm
2. Enable generation of GeometricSets to support growing rate 1~4

A Geometric Set with stage N means there are jobs with length [l, l * alpha, l * alpha^2, ... l * alpha^(N-1)].
Let N = 20 if alpha = 2
    N = 10 if alpha = 4
    N = 25 if alpha = 1.5

For all three options of alpha = 1.5; 2; 4, generate a Geometric Sets job sequence

Use jobs_generate.py to generate Geometric Sets with stage N
Run ./jobs_generate.py 
    Choose SchemeGeometricSets
    Enter N
    Enter ratio = alpha
By default, the generation would be stored into job_base/SchemeGeometricSet
Store the result of the generation in directory ./jobs under this E3 and name each job sequence by its alpha ratio

Create 3 configuration files under this directory. These files will be used to set up machine we will use.
Copy and paste the following into config1:

1
2 2 
1

Copy and paste the following into config2:

1
2 4
10

Copy and paste the following into config3:

1
2 1.5
10

If any changes occur to this experiment in future, a great approach to change the behavior of the experiment is to modify config.
Consult ConfigFileFormat to understand how it works

Change directory to MMIS

Run ./main.py --experiment Experiment/E3/config1 --jb Experiment/E3/jobs --repeat 50 > Experiment/E3/result1 
Run ./main.py --experiment Experiment/E3/config2 --jb Experiment/E3/jobs --repeat 50 > Experiment/E3/result2 
Run ./main.py --experiment Experiment/E3/config3 --jb Experiment/E3/jobs --repeat 50 > Experiment/E3/result3 

Result[x] records how algorithm used in config[x] performs.
