Objectives
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This experiment is to extend the previous experiment E1: we will explore how stable "Greedy-2" could maintain when the PUS sequence changes in a broader sense. More context is provided in E1/README

(a, b) is a parameter of PUS Scheme that controls lengths of jobs such that any generated jobs would be of length between a and b.
Benevolent function is another parameter of PUS Scheme that determines values of jobs based lengths of jobs.  

We know for the fixed (a,b) and the fixed benevolent function we used in E1, the competitive ratio did not change significantly as p varies, but we want to see if this stability exists for different (a, b) or different benevolent function.
 
Particularly, we will redo experiment E1 few times except that for each time we will use different combination of (a, b) and benevolent function

Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Most steps are merely repetition of experiment E1, and we omit details here. There is plenty of useful information in E1/README. Therefore, we will treat E1 as a blackbox block of experiment, and use it abstractly.   

Create folders E2.1, E2.2, E2.3, E2.4, E2.5, E2.6, E2.7, E2.8, E2.9

Use different combinations of (a, b) and benevolent functions to do experiment E1. The location to store relevant files should be changed to E2.x

Use input files to reduce time typing parameters since most input parameters will be the same
E2.1: (Just Copy & Paste E1)
    a = 5 
    b = 25   
    f = y
E2.2:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y^2
E2.3:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y^3
E2.4:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y
E2.5:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y^2
E2.6:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y^3
E2.7:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y
E2.8:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y^2
E2.9:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y^3
