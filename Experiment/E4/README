Objectives
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This experiment is to extend the previous experiment E2: we will conduct the same experiment but use "Greedy-2,4" and "Greedy-2,1.5" algorithms. More context is provided in E2/README

In addition, we want to schedule job sequences with these benevolent functions: 1. combinations of elementary polynomial; 2. exponential function 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Procedures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Create folders E4.1, E4.2, E4.3, E4.4, E4.5, E4.6, E4.7, E4.8, E4.9, E4.10, E4.11, E4.12

Use different combinations of (a, b) and benevolent functions to do the experiment. We can copy and paste E2.x to be E4.x since they E4 is 
an extension of E2 

Use input files to reduce time of typing parameters since most input parameters will be the same input files and job file

Example input file(First input of E4.10):
1
0.05
5
25
lambda y:y + y*y + y*y*y
100
Y

Furthremore, generating input files has also been automated. We used a bash file run3.sh to complete this process
These are parameters used to generate the job bases, update run3.sh with these parameters whenver it will be executed

E4.1:
    a = 5 
    b = 25   
    f = y
E4.2:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y^2
E4.3:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y^3
E4.4:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y
E4.5:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y^2
E4.6:
    a = 4
    b = 100   
    f = y^3
E4.7:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y
E4.8:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y^2
E4.9:
    a = 1
    b = 125   
    f = y^3
E4.10:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y + y^2 + y^3
E4.11:
    a = 5
    b = 25   
    f = y + 2 * y^2 + 3 * y^3
E4.12
    a = 5
    b = 25
    f = e ^ y    

Few bash files that help speed up the process are placed in E2. Try to use them wisely to reduce labor.
Ideally, most jobs for this experiment are done by modifying and running these bash files  

First, we should change the file config to be config1, and the folder result to be result1; 
Then we should create config2 as well as config3 to represent "Greedy-2,4" and "Greedy-2,1.5"

config1:
1
2 2
1

config2:
1
2 4
10

config3:
1
2 1.5
10

Change run1.sh, run2.sh run3.sh and clip.py:
1. Change directory from E2 to be E4
2. In run2, replace config by config1, result by result2
3. In run2, add two more experiment commands, using config2 and config3 respectively 
4. Update clip.py to accommodate more than one result directory 

Steps to take for each sub-experiment:
1. update run1.sh, run2.sh and run3.sh
2. run run3.sh, run1.sh, run2.sh in this order in their appropriate directory
4. go to directory E4.x and run clip.py to see the result

Result
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter how p varies, all experiments exihibited near 1 competitive ratio and small variations over job base
as desired. However, figures from some results are higher than the others. I will list expected competitive 
ratio and variations of all experiments as below:

(a, b), f(x) of job base    Expected comp ratio     Variation over job base
(5, 25), f(y) = y           1.066                   0.0004
(5, 25), f(y) = y^2         1.092                   0.0009
(5, 25), f(y) = y^3         1.100                   0.0011
(4, 100), f(y) = y          1.092                   0.0018      
(4, 100), f(y) = y^2        1.124                   0.0030
(4, 100), f(y) = y^3        1.140                   0.0045
(1, 125), f(y) = y          1.105                   0.0025
(1, 125), f(y) = y^2        1.132                   0.0043
(1, 125), f(y) = y^3        1.148                   0.0065

By observation, we can see as the difference between lengths of jobs increases, expectation of 
competitive ratio and variation increase;
Also, as the degree of polynomial increases, expectation of competitive ratio and variation increase
